The app detects if the Banana leaf is healthy or is it diseased namely Cordana and Sigatoka.The Leaf Check App has features like detecting if the banana leaf is diseased or not . The Banana leaf can be uploaded via Camera or Gallery. The app gives information about how to prevent the diseases namely Sigatoka and Cordana. The app also redirects to the nearest horticulture department. For this project , we have used Alexnet model which was trained using 5000 images.This model was compared with Densenet and Alexnet performed better than Densenet. The saved Alexnet model was converted to tensorflow lite and integrated with Android app.
